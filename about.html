<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/pic03.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span><strong>The Human-Robot Interaction(HRI)</strong> and Robot Intelligence(RI) Group, as a part of Robotics and Media Institute in KIST, is one of the most active research units for intelligent robots in Korea. HRI and robot intelligence are the multidisciplinary fields with contributions from humanâ€“computer interaction, artificial intelligence, robotics, natural language understanding, design, medical and social sciences. Our group is mainly interested in the following research areas:

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/pic03.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>The HRI and RI Group aims to develop the fundamental technologies on the above areas and tries to make them useful in many practical applications, not only robotics fields but other industries. As recent applications, our group have developed a socially assistive robotic companion to help some autistic children and have been also developing a life-care robot to monitor and socially assist dementia patients.
In all the HRI and robot intelligence areas, the HRI and RI Group can be a direct contact point for the related companies, and offer a lot of technological know-hows and a broad variety of experts as well as the latest technologies required to help them achieve their goals. The group is trying to provide applied R&Ds in almost all HRI and RI sectors for a broad range of robotic industries.
