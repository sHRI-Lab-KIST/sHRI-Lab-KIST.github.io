  Human-Robot Interaction is the study of interactions between humans and robots. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines humanâ€“computer interaction, artificial intelligence, robotics, natural language understanding, design, and social sciences. Our lab is mainly interested in the following research areas

  - Socialbility model for Social robot
  - Visual Perception for robot
  - Advanced Navigation
  - Robot Audition

  We aim to develop the fundamental technologies on the above areas and tries to make them useful in many practical applications, not only robotics fields but other industries. Social Robot is still a rather young area, there is active development and research in many areas. The social robot will soon penetrate deep into our lives.
