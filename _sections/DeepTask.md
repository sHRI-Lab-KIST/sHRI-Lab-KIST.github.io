# About DeepTask

## What is the DeepTask?
<img src="../assets/images/project/deeptask/plan.png" width="900">

DeepTask는 로봇-사용자간 사회적 상호작용 가능한 소셜 지능의 지식화, 인식, 표현 기술 및 서비스 패키지 생성 기술 개발을 목적으로 하는 프로젝트입니다.
로봇이 사회성을 갖기 사회적 단서 해독 능력을 갖고 사회적 모델에 따라서 현재의 환경을 이해하고 사회적 의사 표현. 언어적 단서와 사회적 거리, 신체 방향, 얼굴 표정과 같은 비언어적를 복합적으로 이해하면 로봇은 사회적 단서 해독 능력을 가질 수 있습니다.
사회적 인간-로봇 상호작용을 위한 심층이해 기반의 지식 및 태스크 모델링
(Deep understanding-based modeling of Task and Knowledge For Social human-robot interaction)
* 사회성(Sociality) : 환경에 적합한 행동을 나타내는 적응 과정
* [사회적 상호작용(Social Interaction)](#사회적-상호작용) : 자신과 타인의 사회도덕적 관계, 사회 제도를 이해하고 상호작용 하는것

<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/pic03.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span><strong>The Human-Robot Interaction(HRI)</strong> and Robot Intelligence(RI) Group, as a part of Robotics and Media Institute in KIST, is one of the most active research units for intelligent robots in Korea. HRI and robot intelligence are the multidisciplinary fields with contributions from human–computer interaction, artificial intelligence, robotics, natural language understanding, design, medical and social sciences. Our group is mainly interested in the following research areas: 
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="6u 12u">
            <h3>Human-Robot Interaction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>VIsual Perception for Robot (Object Recognition, Tracking, Behavior Analysis</li>
				<li>Robot Audition (Sound Localization, Sound Classification)</li>
				<li>Human Motion and Analysis for Humanoid Robots</li>
				<li>Social Robot</li>
			</ul>
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u">
            <h3>Robot Intelligence</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Vision-based Semantic Navigation</li>
                <li>Vision-based Manipulation with Affordance Concept</li>
                <li>Multi-agent Robots (AV-fusion based Leader-Following)</li>
                <li>Intelligent S/W Architecture and Learning for Robot Intelligence</li>
                <li>Rehabilitation/Assist Robots with Social Cognition</li>
            </ol>
    </div>
</div>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/pic03.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>The HRI and RI Group aims to develop the fundamental technologies on the above areas and tries to make them useful in many practical applications, not only robotics fields but other industries. As recent applications, our group have developed a socially assistive robotic companion to help some autistic children and have been also developing a life-care robot to monitor and socially assist dementia patients.
In all the HRI and robot intelligence areas, the HRI and RI Group can be a direct contact point for the related companies, and offer a lot of technological know-hows and a broad variety of experts as well as the latest technologies required to help them achieve their goals. The group is trying to provide applied R&Ds in almost all HRI and RI sectors for a broad range of robotic industries.

This Jekyll theme lets you build as many of these sections as you want. They live in the _sections folder in your project's root directory. For some examples, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue). Just be sure to add some [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to each section.

All sections have titles, which are listed in the site's navigation menu. At the top of each section, the section's title will render by default (e.g., Welcome to Jekyll!). If you want it to show something different (see Intro), add **auto-header: none** to your frontmatter, and add your text in a <h2> tag inside a <header> tag outside the frontmatter. You'll want to give each section an **order** parameter, also in the frontmatter, or it won't know where to put itself and will hide. Icons are from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

You may notice that this section is written in Markdown -- either Markdown or html works!
